				Hi, my name is Karina.</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Right now: <br>I work as a software engineer on the Performance Team at Cisco Systems, spending half my time on automation projects and the rest on internal customer engagement/training with AppDynamics. 
				<p>Not too long ago:<br>I graduated from Wellesley College in 2016 with a degree in Computer Science and Math. 
					<p>More about me: <br>In my free time, I share jokes that I find on the internet and throw around a plastic plate.
